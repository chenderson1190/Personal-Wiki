<p>This is a collection of what I have done for the College Radio Station 91.7 WPCR
as of 24 October 2019, and documents on how to replicate if anything happens.</p>
<div>
  <h2>Streaming</h2>
  <p>This is probably the biggest thing I've done for the station, and its also very simple
    to set up. <a href="https://www.live365.com">Live365</a> is what I've been using to do this,
    and as of now we dont have a permanent account with them, so I've been using their
    free trial mechanic to go week by week until we get one. The <a href="StreamingSetupSteps.html">steps</a>
    to set this up are very simple, I also like to use <a href="http://danielnoethen.de/butt/">B.U.T.T</a>
    to broadcast to Live365. It's very simple to use, and it has a clean, older-looking interface which I
    am very fond of.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Broadcast Recording</h2>
  <p>While I solely am not the one who got this working, I did have a hand. Currently
    you can only record directly on the PC, but we are working to get the MiniDisc player
    working. This is also very simple but can seem daunting. This is useful if you
    want to record UEG's, CQ's, or anything else really. The microphone is very
    high quality and picks up even the littlest amount of noise, so the door should
    be closed before you click record.</p>
    <p>To record a broadcast, the steps are very simple.
      <ol>
        <li>Log on to the computer in the Recording Studio.</li>
        <li>Open Audacity, and click "Start Monitoring", to see if you are
        getting any audio input.</li>
        <li>If audio input is being received, click the record button in Audacity.
        If audio input is not being recevied, troubleshoot, or contact someone.</li>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Organization and Legal</h2>
  <p>Although not much HAS been done with these two topics in the past, as of 2019
  the club execs have been trying to become FCC compliant again (or we will get taken off air...).
  There are a few legal stipulations that really need to be caught up with and
  watched over, being:
  <ul>
    <li>Every quarter a BMI log for three random consecutive days must be pulled.</li>
    <li>We <strong>must</strong> keep <a href="files/wpcr/MusicLogTwoSided.pdf">music</a> and <a href="files/wpcr/2020ProgramLogs.pdf">program</a> logs for every show.</li>
    <li>We <em>can not</em> stream without a way to broadcast the names, albums,
    and artists that we are playing.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>Eric St. Jean ended up moving the Windows 10 Desktop that was being used for
    streaming into the Recording Studio. The old Windows 7 Machine that was in
    the studio previously is now deprecated, and we will hopefully be getting
    a new Mac for broadcast soon (as of 10/12/2019).

  <h2>The Website</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.plymouth.edu/wpcr/">Plymouth.edu/wpcr</a>, my pride and
  joy. This website was definitely not the best before I came into it. I have been
  trying to update the Bios section for some time but it is very hard to get
  people to send the bios to me... Either way, I have been editing it using Cornerstone,
  a very useful wordpress tool that makes editing super easy. I have also made
  templates of most repeatable things so it is very easy for me to add things like
  bios as needed with the click of a button.</p>
